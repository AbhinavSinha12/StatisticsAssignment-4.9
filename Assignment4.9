Assignment 4.9

Problem Statement 1:

You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard
deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?

Step 1:
z = (x – μ) / σ
Substitute our X-value into the z-score equation. For this sample question the X-value is our SAT score, 1100.

Z = (1100 - μ) / σ

Step 2: Now substituting the mean, μ, into the z-score equation.
(1100 - 1026) / σ

Step 3: Substituting standard deviation, σ into the z-score equation.
(1100 - 1026) / 209

Step 4: So the result comes as
(1100 – 1026) / 209 = .354. 

This shows that the scored value is above the mean.
